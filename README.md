# StarShip-IA-2
The second game of SatrShip AI.<br>
After having some limberness issues with the first game I decided to make it again but better and with fitter tools.<br>
So, in this game I practiced with Class and more new stuff. I also Learnd a lot of Menus, Dictionary, the importance of order<br>
AND MUCH MORE!!<br>
<br>
so... Thank you :)<br>
<br>
There is on BUG I didn't manage to fix without starting to re think the whole project.<br>
The game can be played, but it is still annoying. It regards upgrading Units (Laneny + Workshop + Other_Robot).<br>
I wrote a report inside the game about it, and how to handle it.<br>
<br>
The game might be too easy.<br>
enjoy!<br>
<br>
cool.<br>
